Cedreo shall not be held liable by any third party, including you, in any event of unauthorized access, use and/or disclosure of information provided that such is not due to Gross Negligence, willful misconduct, fraud or bad faith by Cedreo.\n\nSecurity measures adopted by Cedreo include:\n\n* Access to the information stored within Cedreo’s servers is restricted to a limited number of Cedreo employees,\n* The Site and the Service are all secured by SSL protocol, which provides encryption to all data transmitted,\n* Cedreo’s servers are protected by a) firewalls establishing a barrier between our trusted, secure internal network and the Internet and b) IP restrictions, limiting access to whitelisted IPs,\n* Cedreo uses third-party vendors and hosting partners (such as Google Cloud) to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology to run the Service. These vendors all offer best-in-class security.\n* When payments are processed via credit card, Cedreo uses third party vendors that are PCI_DSS compliant.\n\nCedreo takes reasonable security measures to protect your personal information to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
