The Parties shall by mutual agreement appoint a mediator. If at the end of a period of ten \\[10\\] days, the Parties are unable to agree on the choice of the latter, the mediator shall be appointed by the Chair of the Commercial Court of Nantes (44) ruling in summary at the request of the most diligent party.\n\nThis mediator shall bring the parties together, note any useful findings and inform them of the consequences of their respective positions. The mediator must propose, within sixty \\[60\\] days, the elements of a solution likely to settle their dispute while safeguarding their legitimate interests. This proposal shall not be binding or enforceable. The costs and fees of this mediator shall be divided equally between the parties.\n\nIn case of mediation failure, jurisdiction is given to the Courts located within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal of Rennes which alone can be called upon, including in the case of third party claims or multiple defendants."
